# Useful resources

The [SDL wiki](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/FrontPage) is your best friend.

The wiki contains a lot of useful resources, including the
[API reference](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/APIByCategory)
that includes a description of every function's **usage and details**.

The more important of those will be mentioned
as comments in the source code of these examples.
